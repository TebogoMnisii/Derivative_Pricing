# 📈 Derivative Pricing in Python

A derivatives pricing engine implemented in Python, supporting the Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo simulation models.

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ **Black-Scholes Model** for European Call and Put options
- ✅ **Monte Carlo Simulation** for option pricing with random paths
- 📊 Matching results for validation and model testing
- 🔍 Easily extensible for Greeks computation or other pricing models

## 🧠 Models Used

- **Black-Scholes Formula**: Closed-form analytical solution.
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Path-based simulation using random normal distributions.



Black-Scholes Call Price: 10.45
Monte Carlo Call Price: 10.45
Black-Scholes Put Price: 5.57
Monte Carlo Put Price: 5.57

To-Do
 Implement GPU acceleration (e.g., with CuPy)

 Add Binomial Tree Model

 Include Greeks: Delta, Gamma, Vega, etc.
